# Monostro WordPress theme.

This is a complete rewrite of the brilliantly simple design of
[Monospace](http://wordpress.org/themes/monospace) by Vinicius Massuchetto,
built with [_s](http://underscores.me). It is supposed to be a copy of Monospace
but with a more modern standard (Monospace has not been updated in years) and a
few tweaks/extra features as well.

Extra features:

- jQuery 2
- Responsive design (tablet and mobile-modes)

## To do

- Show last updated dates
- Screenshot
